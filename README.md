# Crypto API

This is the backend to a react native application that I am building. I'm using the [https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/](CoinMarketCap) api to gather the data I need to send to the client side.

The backend is being built with node and express.

## ToDo

- [x] Create /api routes
- [ ] Create utility functions to get the data from the CoinMarketCap api
- [ ] use axios to fetch the data from the CoinMarketCap api
- [ ] send the data needed for the app to the route in JSON form
